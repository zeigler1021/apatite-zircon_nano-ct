# data

This directory holds all the data files used in the main code. 2D calculations and selected derived 3D outputs were calculated using the 2D-calculations script and added to the data collected. After that, these files were not touched and therefore contain all relevant, high-quality, nano-CT data for apatite dataset.  

20220704_apatite-data is the main data file 
20220718_size-distribution is a data file used to make Fig02
date-eu-hecalc is a data file used to make Fig07 (taken from table D01)


The percent difference files are simply the numbers required to plot the percent difference lines on the regression plots.
