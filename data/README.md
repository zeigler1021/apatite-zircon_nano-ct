# data

This directory hold all the data files used in the main code. 2D calculations and selected derived 3D outputs were calculated using the 2D-calculations script and added to the data collected. after that, these files were not touched and therefore contain all relevent, high-quality, nano-CT data for both apatite and zircon datasets.  

The percent difference files are simply the numbers required to plot the percent difference lines on the regression plots.
